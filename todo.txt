REFACTORS

* FINISH + CLEAN UP BITBOARD, EXTRACT COMMON BOARD METHODS
- look for side effects, try to refactor out
- consider namedtuple for data-only immutable classes
- fix test cases, add test cases for methods missing them

- _method = internal, not private. rename + reorder methods accordingly
- !!! tests: clean up per clean code book recs, should be individual, not sequential
- mock testing
- more informative return values?
- error handling (ex: board.set_piece)
- look into potentially using yields for performance
- replace board_controller.SimpleBoard() with immutable board hash?
- make pyright happy, fix "# pyright:..." comments
- engine: get eval bar score
- convert minimax to negamax?
- movestrats: fix abs class var weird implementation, find cleaner solution
