REFACTORS
- mock testing
- testcase cleanup (readability)
- more informative return values
- error handling (ex: board.set_piece)
- movestrat: update is_valid_move to take single move arg
- update all methods that have "move" to use Move (where it makes sense)
- board.make_move/undo_move: bool return types
- board.init: allow empty board creation? usecase?
- redo tests with pytest instead
- Color: static method -> prop
* class refactor, MLO
- movestrat: static methods?
- spell out for all public-facing methods/params/fields/vars
- look into potentially using yields for performance
- make pyright happy
- replace board_controller.board() with immutable board hash?
- piece: make some fields class-level consts
- be consistent with checking for piece type vs move strat type
